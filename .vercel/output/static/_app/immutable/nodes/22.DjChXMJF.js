        snack options that are all under 200 calories and packed with nutrients.</p> <h2>1. Greek Yogurt with Berries (150 calories)</h2> <p>A perfect combination of protein and antioxidants. Mix 1/2 cup of
        non-fat Greek yogurt with 1/4 cup of mixed berries. The protein will
        keep you full, while the berries provide natural sweetness and important
        vitamins.</p> <h2>2. Apple with Almond Butter (180 calories)</h2> <p>Slice one medium apple and pair it with 1 tablespoon of almond butter.
        This snack provides fiber, healthy fats, and a satisfying crunch that
        will keep hunger at bay.</p> <h2>3. Hard-Boiled Egg with Cucumber (120 calories)</h2> <p>One hard-boiled egg with 1/2 cup of sliced cucumber. High in protein and
        very low in calories, this is perfect for when you need something
        substantial but light.</p> <h2>4. Hummus with Carrot Sticks (140 calories)</h2> <p>2 tablespoons of hummus with 1 cup of carrot sticks. This snack is rich

        satisfying treat.</p> <h2>6. Mixed Nuts (170 calories)</h2> <p>A small handful (about 1/4 cup) of mixed nuts like almonds, walnuts, and
        cashews. Packed with healthy fats and protein, nuts are perfect for
        curbing hunger between meals.</p> <h2>7. Edamame (120 calories)</h2> <p>1/2 cup of shelled edamame. These young soybeans are high in protein and

        salt. This provides healthy fats and a satisfying crunch without too
        many calories.</p> <h2>9. Protein Smoothie (190 calories)</h2> <p>Blend 1 scoop of protein powder with 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk
        and 1/2 cup of frozen berries. This is perfect for post-workout recovery
        or as a meal replacement.</p> <h2>10. Dark Chocolate with Almonds (170 calories)</h2> <p>1 ounce of dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher) with 10 almonds. This
        combination satisfies your sweet tooth while providing antioxidants and
        healthy fats.</p> <h2>Tips for Smart Snacking</h2> <ul><li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Prepare snacks in advance to avoid reaching
          for unhealthy options when hunger strikes.</li> <li><strong>Portion control:</strong> Measure out your snacks to avoid overeating,
          even with healthy foods.</li> <li><strong>Balance macronutrients:</strong> Include protein, healthy fats,
          and fiber in your snacks for maximum satisfaction.</li> <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Sometimes thirst is mistaken for hunger,
          so drink water throughout the day.</li> <li><strong>Listen to your body:</strong> Eat when you're truly hungry, not
          just out of habit or boredom.</li></ul> <h2>When to Snack</h2> <p>The best times to snack are typically 2-3 hours after a meal, before or
        after a workout, or when you're experiencing genuine hunger. Avoid
        snacking too close to meal times, as this can interfere with your
        appetite for more substantial, balanced meals.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Healthy snacking doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. By
        keeping these options on hand and planning ahead, you can maintain your
        nutrition goals while satisfying your hunger between meals. Remember,
        the key to successful snacking is choosing nutrient-dense foods that
        provide lasting energy and satisfaction.</p></div></article> <div class="mt-12 text-center"><div class="card bg-gradient-to-r from-primary to-accent text-white shadow-xl"><div class="card-body"><h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Ready to Transform Your Nutrition?</h3> <p class="text-lg opacity-90 mb-6">Discover more nutrition tips and healthy recipes to support your
